# Baltimore Homicide Inequality
A project to understand the inequalities in poverty and homicide in Baltimore in 2016 using Open Source data.

There is evidence that poverty and violence go hand-in-hand for a number of reasons. Those who are poor
may come into friction with those who are not. Or the lack of wealth is systemic, learing to a poor public
safety infrasctructure. Or those who are poor do things deemed criminal by society in order to survive.

In this project, I take data from Baltimore on homicides in 2016 and data from the Baltimore Neighborhood
Indicators Alliance (http://bniajfi.org) and see if homicides were inequitably distributed in Baltimore.

This is work that Public Health professionals can reproduce in their own locals (or even in Baltimore)
using their own data and looking at other social and health indicators.
